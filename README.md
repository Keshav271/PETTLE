Pettle 🐾
Winner - HACK N' INNOVATE (INNOHACKS) | Team: INNO-TITANS

Pettle is an AI-driven mental health platform designed to detect early signs of Schizophrenia, Suicidal Intentions, Anxiety, and Depression. By analyzing user-generated content on social media platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp, Pettle identifies mental health struggles that often go unnoticed due to social stigma or lack of awareness.
